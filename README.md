# Schesign graph utils

Schesign allows you to build and host data designs. Data designs can be accessed through the API as a graph in JSON format. See [schesign-js-api](https://github.com/csenn/schesign-js-api) for more info on retrieving a graph.

This library converts this graph into JSON schema.

### Install
```
npm install schesign-js-graph-utils --save
